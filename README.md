# household-power-consumption-final-version

About the dataset: measuremenets of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. 

About the project: this project primarily involves data analysis and visaulization. This includes finding correlations, generating graphs (i.e. line graph, heatmap, boxplot, scatter plot). Futhermore, this project explores machine learning to effectively gain isnights from raw data. It also uses logistic regression, decision tree, random forest regression to make prediction based on the raw data. 

Tools: Pandas, PySpark, Numpy, Sklearn, Searborn, Matplotlib etc.
Programming language: Python
